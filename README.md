# Decred's Timestamply Tutorial

Welcome to the Decred's Timestamply tutorial! This tutorial will guide you on how to use Timestamply by Decred to upload and verify files, and demonstrate its powerful timestamping capabilities.

## Description

Timestamply is a tool developed by Decred that provides decentralized and secure public proof of existence for digital files. By leveraging blockchain technology, Timestamply allows you to prove the existence of something at a specific point in time, without the need for trusted authorities.

This tutorial will cover the following topics:

1. Getting Started
   - What This Tutorial Covers
   - What is Timestamply?

2. How Does Timestamping Work?
   - Understanding the process of timestamping
   - The importance of the Merkle root or hash

## Installation and Usage

To get started with the tutorial, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Timestamply website](https://timestamp.decred.org) to access the Timestamply service.

2. Create a timestamp by uploading a digital file. The file will generate a unique Merkle root or hash, which serves as a proof of its existence.

3. Monitor the status of your timestamp and track its progress as it gets anchored to the blockchain.

4. Once the timestamp is confirmed and irreversible on the blockchain, you can download the proof and verify its authenticity using the Merkle root.

For detailed instructions and examples, please refer to the tutorial chapters mentioned above.
